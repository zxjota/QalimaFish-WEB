    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="small">Effective date: <strong>November 19, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>MEXCNIA</strong> ("we", "us", or "our"). MEXCNIA is a catch-recording mobile application that helps anglers log their catches, photos, locations and fishing notes. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, with whom we share it, and the choices you have regarding your information when you use the MEXCNIA app (the "Service").</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information to provide, maintain, and improve the Service. The types of information we collect include:</p>

    <h3>1.1 Personal Information</h3>
    <p>When you create an account or contact us, we may collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Full name (optional), username</li>
      <li>Email address (required for account & contact), e.g. <code>charleswesonga98@gmail.com</code></li>
      <li>Password (hashed and stored securely)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 User Content</h3>
    <p>Content you upload or create within the app:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Catch records (species, weight, length, bait, notes)</li>
      <li>Photos and videos you upload</li>
      <li>Trip logs and journaling entries</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Device & Usage Information</h3>
    <p>We automatically collect certain technical information about your device and how you use the Service, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device model, operating system version, app version</li>
      <li>Crash reports and diagnostic data</li>
      <li>App usage metrics (features used, timestamps)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.4 Location Information</h3>
    <p>If you allow it, MEXCNIA may collect precise or approximate location data to tag catches or trips. Location access is optional and controlled through your device permissions.</p>

    <h3>1.5 Analytics & Cookies</h3>
    <p>We may use analytics services (e.g., Firebase Analytics, or similar) to understand how the app is used. These services may use cookies or similar technologies to collect information.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information for purposes including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Providing and maintaining the Service</li>
      <li>Storing and displaying your catch records and media</li>
      <li>Personalizing your experience and app settings</li>
      <li>Communicating with you (support, updates, legal notices)</li>
      <li>Detecting and preventing fraud or abuse</li>
      <li>Analyzing usage to improve features and performance</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Sharing & Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>With service providers:</strong> third-party vendors who perform services on our behalf (analytics, cloud storage, crash reporting).</li>
      <li><strong>When you choose to share:</strong> if you publish or export a catch record or media to social networks or public leaderboards, that content may become publicly accessible.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal requirements:</strong> when required by law, to respond to legal process, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of MEXCNIA or others.</li>
      <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets (we will notify users where required by law).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We may use third-party services (e.g., hosting, analytics, mapping services). These providers have their own privacy policies and may collect information as described above. We recommend reviewing the privacy notices of any linked third-party services.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your personal information and user content for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the Service, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. You may delete your account to remove your data — see section <em>Account Deletion</em> below.</p>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect your information. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights & Choices</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights regarding your personal data, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access:</strong> request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.</li>
      <li><strong>Correction:</strong> request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data.</li>
      <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> request deletion of your personal data (subject to legal retention requirements).</li>
      <li><strong>Portability:</strong> request a machine-readable copy of your data.</li>
      <li><strong>Opt-out:</strong> you can opt out of certain communications and analytics collection by changing settings in the app or contacting us.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise these rights, contact us at the address below. We may ask you to verify your identity before responding.</p>

    <h2>8. Children</h2>
    <p>MEXCNIA is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us and we will take steps to delete it.</p>

    <h2>9. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your information may be processed in countries other than your country of residence. Where required, we will take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place as required by applicable law.</p>

    <h2>10. Account Deletion</h2>
    <p>You may delete your MEXCNIA account from the app settings. Deleting your account will remove your user profile and most user content from public view; some copies may remain in backups for a limited period as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by posting the new policy in the app or via the email address on file. The "Effective date" at the top will reflect the date of last revision.</p>
